# Lightweight Personal Website Template
## Author: Kirsten Tempest

This repository contains a **lightweight, sustainability-first HTML template** for a personal or professional website.

It is designed to be:
- static (HTML + CSS only)
- easy to customise
- accessible by default
- low-carbon to host and run

The template is suitable for researchers, developers, designers, or anyone who wants a calm, minimal personal site without frameworks or build tools.

## What this template is for

- A personal “About” page with a lightweight CV / experience section
- A simple blog
- A contact page

The site uses:
- system fonts only (no downloads)
- no JavaScript frameworks
- no external libraries
- no images unless you choose to add them

## How to use this template

1. **Copy or fork this repository** into your own GitHub or GitLab account.
2. Rename the repository to whatever you like.
3. Edit the HTML files:
   - You can customise the site by simply **finding and replacing text** in the HTML.
   - No prior HTML or CSS knowledge is required.
   - Replace names, paragraphs, links (e.g. LinkedIn, Google Scholar) with your own.
4. Optional: tweak colours or spacing in the single CSS file if you wish.

### Hosting

You can host this site **for free** using:
- GitHub Pages  
- GitLab Pages  

Both work well with static HTML sites like this and have a very low operational footprint.

## Sustainability note

As you customise the template, I recommend keeping an eye on its environmental impact.

- You can check your site’s estimated carbon footprint using  
  👉 https://www.websitecarbon.com
- For guidance on building more sustainable websites, see the  
  👉 W3C Web Sustainability Guidelines:  
  https://www.w3.org/TR/web-sustainability-guidelines/

The template is intentionally simple so that it remains:
- fast to load
- low-energy to serve
- easy to maintain over time
